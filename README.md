# Central Authentication Service

A centralized authentication system built with Django REST Framework (DRF) to manage user identity, verification, and session management across multiple applications.

## ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Get (MVP Scope)

1. Custom User Model
   * UUID primary key, email as `USERNAME_FIELD`, optional phone and avatar.
   * Why: Provides a flexible identity schema and consistent user ID across apps.

2. OTP Email Verification
   * Cacheâ€‘backed, hashed oneâ€‘time codes (5â€“10â€¯min TTL).
   * Why: Prevents spam signâ€‘ups and ensures valid email ownership before DB writes.

3. JWT Authentication
   * Endpoints for token obtain/refresh via DRF Simple JWT.
   * Why: Offers stateless, scalable sessions suited to SPAs and microservices.

4. User Info Endpoint (`/api/account/me/`)
   * Returns ID, email, pic, roles, and groups(contain permissions).
   * Why: Standardizes identity checks for all consumer apps without reâ€‘implementing logic.

5. Environmentâ€‘Driven Configuration
   * `.env` support via `django-environ`.
   * Why: Aligns with 12â€‘factor principles and secures sensitive credentials.

6. Rate Limiting & Throttling
   * Protects `/send-otp/` and `/verify-otp/` from abuse.
   * Why: Ensures system availability and defends against bruteâ€‘force attacks.

## ðŸ”œ Postâ€‘MVP & Future Updates

After your first client is integrated, weâ€™ll expand with:

* Lifecycle Hooks (`on_create`, `on_update`, `on_delete`)
  Notify downstream apps of account events for data federation.

* Public/Private Key Trust Model
  Sign requests from central auth and verify in subâ€‘apps for tamperâ€‘proof communication.

* Registered Applications Registry
  Dynamic service discovery for profile provisioning and deletion.

* Asynchronous Sync Queues (Celery/RQ)
  Reliable background jobs with retry/backoff and monitoring dashboards.

## ðŸŽ¯ Professional Rationale

1. Lean MVP First
   Focus on core identity, verification, and session flows to deliver value quickly.
2. Securityâ€‘Byâ€‘Design
   Hashed OTPs, HTTPSâ€‘only cookies, shortâ€‘lived JWTs, and rate limits guard against common threats.
3. Scalable Patterns
   Stateless JWT and cacheâ€‘driven OTPs permit horizontal scaling without session affinity.
4. 12â€‘Factor Compliance
   Environmentâ€‘based settings and modular design ease deployment to any cloud or container platform.
